MOD_MSTESTIMONMENST_MENSTRUAL_1='“Menstrual therapy was not limited to physical issues, it was something much more profound. Being able to find myself at different moments of growth in my life gave me the possibility to heal some issues that had remained unsolved for too long. The therapy also helped me to become friends with my blood and understand the different women living within me.”'
MOD_MSTESTIMONMENST_MENSTRUAL_2='“I feel grateful for convincing myself to start menstrual therapy. In each session I could connect with the four women and get the best of each of them. The fact that I could transform so much pain into love gives me a lot of joy. Having a better relationship with my mother after healing myself just fulfills me. I feel grateful for having the courage to do this experience, to get to know myself better and make the most of myself, to get to know my four women and get the best of each of them and to heal my linage.”'
